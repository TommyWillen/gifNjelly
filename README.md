## Description
Welcome to the repository for gifNjelly! gifNjelly is an application where you can add hilarious captions to gifs, and vote on the captions added by other users. 

!!! ADD ELEVATOR PITCH HERE !!!

We were able to explore a lot of different technologies while building this app. On the front end, we utilized the Bootstrap and JQuery libraries, as well as SweetAlert. Handlebars were used for templating. We also utilized the Giphy API to get random gifs. On the backend we utilized Express, Sequelize, and MySQL. We also used Passport and BCrypt for allowing user logins. Axios was used to hide our API keys. It was incredibly beneficial to have time to practice using all of these technologies.
